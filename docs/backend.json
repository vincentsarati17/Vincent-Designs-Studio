This allows for easy role management without custom claims. The structure focuses on simplicity and security by limiting access based on the existence of a user ID within the `/roles_admin` collection. This approach adheres to Authorization Independence (CRITICAL), and provides Clarity of Intent (Debuggability).\n\nThe structure supports the required QAPs by:\n\n*   **Segregation:**  Admin user data is segregated into its own collection (`/roles_admin`), allowing for specific security rules that apply only to administrative users.\n*   **Global Roles (DBAC):** The existence of a document in `/roles_admin/{uid}` signifies admin status."
